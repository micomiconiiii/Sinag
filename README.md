# Project Overview

In 2022, the Philippine power sector was responsible for over 50% of the country's CO2 emissions, largely due to fossil fuel dependence. Yet, household energy consumption and carbon output remain largely unregulated. Sinag tackles this gap using AI and IoT to monitor and optimize energy consumption. Powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and photodiode sensor, it tracks real-time usage via electric meter blinks (e.g. 1600 impulses = 1 kilowatt-hour). Users gain access to features like real-time bill forecasting, appliance electricity calculator, and carbon footprint tracker. A built-in community platform encourages collaboration through shared sustainability goals and group challenges. By analyzing usage patterns, Sinag delivers AI-driven, personalized recommendations to cut down energy waste. To further promote eco-friendly habits, users earn Sinag Points—redeemable for green appliances through partnered brands or donatable to environmental NGOs—transforming individual accountability into collective climate action, one kilowatt at a time.
